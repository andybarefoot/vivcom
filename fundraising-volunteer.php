                <h1>Volunteering</h1>
                <p>All of our projects have been formulated by our team, to give our self funding volunteers the most meaningful of experiences, wherever they may decide to venture. We take pride in all of our VIVCOM Foundation programs and wish to ensure that our volunteers will benefit the community in a favorable way while on their once in a life time journey.</p>
                <p>The main objective of <a href="index.php">VIVCOM Foundation</a> is to help more people gain the life changing, life affirming experiences that volunteering can give. We are committed to enabling skill transfer, enabling projects at our organization access different skill sets and to helping volunteers realize the value they can add using the skills they hold.</p>
                <p>Our <a href="programs.php">programs</a> allow our volunteers the opportunity to work alongside local and interesting people that help ensure their survival. Working with very willing disadvantaged communities also forms part of the make-up of these incredible life enhancing programs. If properly educated and informed these communities can play an integral part in the overall well being of the environment.</p>
                <p>We hope our volunteers will become responsible global citizens as a result of their experience with VIVCOM Foundation, promoting the need for social change and raising awareness in their home communities on the issues they encountered. Uganda has a lot to offer but also needs support, the support it rightfully deserves.</p>
                <p>See our offers sections: <a href="#solo">Solo Volunteering</a>, <a href="#group">Group Volunteering</a>, <a href="#family">Family Volunteering</a>, <a href="#tailor">Tailor-Made Volunteering</a>, and <a href="#corporate">Corporate Volunteering</a>.</p>
                <p>One of the best ways to really get under the skin of any destination is to actually cover a large amount of ground during your travel. Go where very few get to go.</p>
                <p>VIVCOM Foundation enables people from around the world to share their skills and expertise, welcoming applications from all, regardless of age or experience. We facilitate placements for one or more people, for a minimum of one week and can secure the placement within 48hrs of receiving your inquiry. We offer placements that will either utilize skills you hold already or give opportunity to learn new skills. We will match your skills and expectations with those of our project to ensure your placement is a professionally, as well as a personally, rewarding experience. This is achieved through our rigorous application process, and in depth research into potential project to assess what is needed and what the volunteer can expect.</p>

                <h2>Solo Volunteering</h2>
                <p>Don't have a travel partner? No problem! Traveling solo can be lonely and daunting... But it can also be a rewarding experience of a lifetime if you do it right! The majority of our volunteers travel solo as volunteering with VIVCOM Foundation is a safe and easy way to travel abroad, to give back to a community, and to make friends for life. As they say, you may travel alone, but you are never actually alone.</p>
                <p>Volunteering solo offers a unique way to spend time with the locals or other solo travellers in your group, while helping a community in need.</p>
                <p>As a solo traveller interested in giving back on your travels, you're in a unique position because you can truly lead by your own interests and find a volunteer experience that fits exactly with how you want to spend your trip.</p>
                <p>Stay from one week to over 6 months. The program runs year round - and you choose your custom dates. These trips are not just for younger travellers! Middle-aged and senior volunteers have regularly joined our programs since 2012 and in fact solo volunteering is our most popular package.</p>

                <h2>Group Volunteering</h2>
                <p>VIVCOM Foundation offers a range of options for group volunteering and we're experts in creating customized experiences that expand horizons, foster cross-cultural understanding and make a positive contribution to our community projects.</p>
                <p>Whether it's with your friends, fellow alumni or neighbors, volunteering as a group is a great way to improve needy communities in Uganda.</p>
                <p>Our group volunteering program can accommodate university groups, schools groups, youth groups, families, and corporate teams.</p>
                <p>We create customized itineraries that provide a safe environment for group members to learn, grow and challenge themselves. We do this through impactful volunteer programs and cultural immersion.</p>
                <p>If group volunteering is right for you, get started by contacting us. Tell us about your group and what projects interests you and for how long would you like to come.</p>
                <p>Group volunteering offers communities with great opportunities for getting big jobs done in a short time.</p>
                <p>Groups can get involved in building, painting classrooms, renovation work, and tree planting campaigns, orphanage work, and childcare and teaching academic, social and extracurricular activities. Groups can also work on community development projects like digging clean water supply for communities and so many other tailor made project to suit group interests.</p>
                <p>One-time group opportunities are available throughout the year and are projects that have no specific date and require interested groups to coordinate with us to schedule a date and time that is convenient for both parties. Contact us for more information about group activities available.</p>
                <p>Seasonal one-time opportunities are projects that occur annually around the same time each year and have specific dates and times for these events.</p>

                <h2>Family Volunteering</h2>
                <p>Voluntary work overseas has been traditionally for those who don't have children. Through VIVCOM Foundation you can volunteer in Uganda with your Family!</p>
                <p>Family Volunteering is a fantastic way to travel the world, provide an educational experience, and give back to the places you visit at the same time. Explore new cultures and environments, and give your kids a true hands-on understanding of the wildlife and communities you meet. VIVCOM Foundation can bring you on an unforgettable family volunteering experience in Uganda.</p>
                <p>There are multiple projects at our organization that can host families as the work engages volunteers to develop our different communities and gain hands-on experience, such as orphanage care, construction work to teaching and working with children in preschools. Most of this work can be undertaken by parents whilst the children learn and take part. The work often takes place over week, leaving the weekends to engage in beneficial recreational activities, boat riding and so on.</p>
                <p>Volunteering as a family is something special you can all do together to help teach your kids about thinking larger than themselves.</p>
                <p>Whether there are two of you or you have a big extended family, if you combine efforts to help others - that's volunteering!</p>
                <p>Besides the wonderful benefits to host community, there are many benefits for your family. Research suggests that engaging parents and their children in service together has important positive outcomes for everyone involved.</p>
                <p>There are many benefits to volunteering as a family, but here are our top 5:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Kids and teens cultivate positive values, such as caring and empathy, and develop a commitment to service both now and in the future.</li>
                    <li>By participating in volunteer activities, kids and teens feel appreciated and respected, as well as learn new skills in the process.</li>
                    <li>Parents get to spend quality time with their children in a positive environment, while serving as role models, leading by example and passing on important values.</li>
                    <li>Families increase their sense of cohesion, well-being, and connections to the broader community.</li>
                    <li>The combination of ages and generations within a family means they have everything needed to make meaningful change in the community: energy, creativity, passion, knowledge and experience, as well as different perspectives and skills.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A family volunteer program abroad will be a great challenge, far removed from everyday life at home and away from a typical holiday sitting on a beach all day watching your children hooked on the iPad. A family volunteer program will enable you and your children to go out, learn, volunteer and experience something worthwhile far away from the school classroom, which will be remembered for the rest of your lives.</p>

                <h2>Corporate Volunteering</h2>
                <p>Businesses are giving more than financial support to the communities in need. They are offering their most valuable asset: their employees' time.</p>
                <p>Employer supported volunteering, or corporate volunteering, is growing in popularity, with companies recognizing their responsibilities to their stakeholders and the impact that they have on the needy communities through their Corporate Social Responsibility practices.</p>
                <p>Corporate volunteering provides a great platform to engage staff with our non-profit organization, which can benefit the employee, employer and, of course, community in need.</p>
                <p>Volunteering as a company team can be perfect for your company. Corporate volunteerism is a bonding experience, and an excellent way to learn more about the individual members of your team while making a positive difference in our vulnerable communities.</p>
                <p>Volunteers can learn important skills like teamwork, personal development, and leadership while giving service. At VIVCOM Foundation we have a number of volunteer opportunities that are open and willing to accommodate large groups of 10 or more.</p>
                <p>Become a corporate volunteering member or let us help you to engage your employees.</p>
                <p><a href="volunteer-form.php">Apply Now</a> or <a href="contact-us.php">contact us</a> for more information on how you can engage your company in social service in Uganda.</p>

                <h2>Tailor Made Volunteering</h2>
                <p>VIVCOM Foundation begun this Tailor-Made Volunteering program just to cater for the gap between our volunteers and fixed opportunities we have. The idea behind 'tailor made' volunteering is simple but effective. We find you a volunteering position that matches with your education, skills and interests. Usually, this only has to take a day or two.</p>
                <h2>How?</h2>
                <p>Instead of advertising a volunteering position to you, we advertise your skills to our projects. You tell us about your education, employment history and interests and our organization in Uganda find you a volunteering position which enables you to draw upon these skills. We maintain an extensive network of projects and enjoy the full support of the local community in order to achieve high quality placements.</p>
                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>It just makes more sense to have volunteers doing things that they are good at. As a volunteer, you are a resource of development. In order to give you every chance of maximizing your contribution to development, you must be placed effectively. In order to be placed effectively, you need to be working in an area that fits your experience.</p>
                <h2>What skills are relevant?</h2>
                <p>Almost all university degrees or college status can be applied to development. Even if you are still an undergraduate, the knowledge you possess has practical applications. Almost all professional backgrounds can be made useful to development. If you have other skills and interests, in many cases they can also become effective tools of development.</p>
                <p>If you want to find out how your knowledge and skills can be useful: <a href="contact-us.php">contact us</a></p>
                <p>Tell us about your qualifications, your employment history and any other skills you possess. We will help you discover how your abilities can be made relevant to development in our country.</p>
                <p>Based on the information you provide us with, we will find you a suitable volunteer placement. This really is the most effective way to volunteer and it does not cost you anything to find out what you could be doing. So pick up the phone or write us an email</p>
                <h2>You must know before you come</h2>
                <p>The very nature of our 'tailor made' volunteer program ensures that you will be placed in a suitable position.</p>
                <p>For our 'fixed' volunteer positions, we do make sure that the experience and education of our volunteers fit the demands of the role they have applied for.</p>
                <p>As a rule, the level of your experience will reflect the caliber of your position.</p>
                <p>However, there are some practical requirements that are quite essential:</p>
                <p>You should understand that Africa is a challenging place to be. It is not always easy to communicate with the locals and there will not always be other volunteers positioned near you; in these circumstances you might be the only non-Ugandan around.</p>
                <p>This can prove to be a major advantage, but can also be difficult to readjust to. Not everybody is fit to come to Africa. You need to keep in mind that Uganda can be both physically and mentally very challenging.</p>
                <p>VIVCOM Foundation does not 'screen' volunteers. We assume that you already wanted to come to Uganda to volunteer, and we just function to make sure you get the most out of your time.</p>
                <p>You must arrange proper health insurance for yourself. Please understand that VIVCOM Foundation does not insure any unexpected costs, medical or otherwise, for you. We can, however, recommend you some reliable hospitals while here in Uganda.</p>

                    <li>Secondly, we would like you to bring your favorite book and add it to the book collection.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We hope to see you here in Uganda very soon and if you are already here, we hope you might make some time in your travel schedule and stay with us for a while.</p>
                <p>As we are in a period of tremendous growth, there are many expenses that come with this. As you make your decision to volunteer here, we appreciate any efforts you might make towards fundraising within your own community on our behalf. Anything you can donate towards making your stay as comfortable as possible is particularly appreciated. This could be books, solar lanterns, extra furniture, renovation costs or anything you can think that will make you and future volunteers feel more comfortable.</p>
                <p>You are welcome to the Pearl of Africa!</p>
