                <h1>Brenda Econia: General Secretary</h1>
                <img class="text-photo" src="../images/team/brenda.jpg">
                <p>My name is Brenda Econia, born on 1st-December-1995. I am an Orphan raised in Police barracks, my father having served our country died in a motor accident in the line of duty, this living me and 5 my siblings as partial orphans since my father was the sole bread winner of the family, life became so unspeakable forcing us to relocate to a very affordable house in the slum characterized byshanty housing set ups, poor drainage systems and with barely a meal a day for I and my family. My education life culminated with a lot of turmoil since I had to double school with child labor to make ends meet at such a tender age.</p>
                <p>The plight of my childhood memories instigate my spirit of volunteering and doing charity work so as to help the underprivileged like myself earn a sense of belonging and at least acquire the very basic necessities in life. "Give freely to the poor and do not wish that you didn't have to give, then the Lord your God will bless your work and everything you do." Deuteronomy 15:10.</p>
