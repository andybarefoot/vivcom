                <p>VIVCOM believes vision families are the basic units of all social and spiritual development because they are the primary sources of socialization, which moral obligation can be copied or transferred to the wider Vision Homestead; the vision homes are a good example and agents of change to other homes in the community.</p>
                <p>With the VIVCOM physical- social network its incumbent upon members of the wider stead to ensure that children and members act morally upright in a manner that is befitting in the homestead and in society. Through the vision Social Capital Trust (VSCT) vision homes build relationships based on trust to instill a habit of helping one another in times of need, as VIVCOM we believe trust is the foundation upon which relationships thrive. In order to strengthen such relationships we strongly emphasize exchange visits amongst vision families where the host family not only feeds the visiting family but also gives a valuable gift that can be reproductive and thereby improving the standard of living of the visiting family, this makes the vision exchange visits more productive while the other family witnesses that such a gift grows to benefit the receiver family. Proverbs 21:28.</p>
                <p>During the week vision families meet in homestead cells to draw inspiration from the word of God and VIVCOM identifies competent persons who could come to share as well as talk to the vision families through VIVCOM speaker series, this gives encouragement as well as share of experience with such persons deemed suitable. </p>
