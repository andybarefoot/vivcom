                <p>VIVCOM engages all vision children in many extra-curricular activities, such as soccer, Music Dance and Drama, which helps to foster the psycho-social development of the children. Youth workers, operating under the social work umbrella, facilitate activities (interpersonally and in groups) which helps the children deal with and overcome any trauma and brokenness from their past, VIVCOM identifies places deemed fit for children to engage in sports and leisure, vision parents during such events hand the children to the VIVCOM sports coordinators.</p>
                <p>VIVCOM believes children have inherent talent and profound abilities, which if well harvested, can be beneficial to these children and the community as a whole; itâ€™s from this perspective that VIVCOM identifies talented members such as athletes, artists, doctors and from various professions both locally and internationally to inspire vision children.</p>
