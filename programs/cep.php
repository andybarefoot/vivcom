                <h2>Summer Work Camp:</h2>
                <p>Each summer Vision For Vulnerable Communities Foundation hosts volunteers from around the world for a month (four weeks), for the annual Summer Work Camp to support the organization in a specific project that will give back to the community. Volunteers have the Â  opportunity to get to work with people in the community and begin to understand the local context while engaging with the community they are supporting. We emphasize hands-on learning and cultural exchange. We have used this program to better reach the youth audience in Western countries looking to enrich a study-abroad or travel opportunity by visiting Uganda. These young people become a power resource and a network for VIVCOM Foundation to capitalize on.</p>
