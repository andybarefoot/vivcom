                <p>VVCOM will have Vision clinic not only for the use of our underprivileged vision homes and vulnerable children but it will also be available to the surrounding community. The clinic will meet the everyday healthcare needs of the Vision Homesteads and surrounding community and regular missions from medical teams will help take care of their special medical requirements during the year.</p>
                <p>VIVCOM Foundation also encourages all Vision families to grow medicines such as Aloe vera which are medicinal, acquire mosquito nets and conducts continuous monthly community work in the homestead to ensure good hygiene and rewarding the community for instance tiding and maintaining of the community water collecting points.</p>
