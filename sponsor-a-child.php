                <h1>Sponsor a Child</h1>
                <p>Busy people often regret that time does not permit their desire to help in practical ways. But there is another, personal way to give a child the opportunities that you would wish for yourself and your family. Providing a regular donation will help us pay for food, clothing, medicine, and education for children in deprived areas in Uganda. Can you imagine being an orphaned and vulnerable child in a remote African State like Uganda?</p>
                <h2>How we choose whom to sponsor?</h2>
                <p>We are born and raised in Slum areas and so we know which people need the help. We also work hand in hand with the community leaders who refer most of the beneficiaries to our office. We also do a need assessment on a monthly basis and community mapping to identify families that need help in Nabweru.</p>
                <h2>Sponsor a Child:</h2>
